## Installation

You probably already did this part hundreds of times in the past, you know what to do you're smart:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Joplys/linux-wallpaperengine-TUI
cd linux-wallpaperengine-TUI
chmod +x walliwalli.sh
cp walliwalli.sh ~/.local/bin/walliwalli
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`. If it isn't, add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, or don't, im not your boss:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

On first run, the TUI should (SHOULD NOT WILL) automatically detect your Steam/Wallpaper Engine workshop directory. On the off-chance it can't find it, you can set it manually via **Settings → Library → Edit wallpaper directory**.

## Usage

Just run:

```bash
walliwalli.sh
```

A cool fuzzy-searchable list of your wallpaperengine wallpapers should appear, if it doesn't then your directory wasn't detected so go to settings and add it :<

Press Escape or Ctrl+C to exit without launching anything.

If you want to restore the wallpaper you were using after turning off your computer you can just add this to your autostart file

```bash
linux-wallpaperengine --screen-root DP-3 --volume 100 --fullscreen-pause-only-active --fps 30 --bg "$(<$HOME/.cache/walliwalli/we-last-wallpaper-DP-3)"
```

Oh also the settings menu is really useful, GO CHECK IT, you WILL use it.
